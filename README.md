üß† SQL-Agent

Turn natural language into SQL, visualizations, and insights with ease.
Built with Agentic AI + LLMs, this project automates end-to-end data analysis across any SQL database.

üåü Overview

SQL-Agent is a multi-agent system that bridges LLMs and SQL databases. It allows users to ask questions in plain English and get back SQL queries, data visualizations, structured tables, and LLM-driven insights‚Äîall in a single pipeline.

The system is database-agnostic, lightweight, and modular, making it easy to integrate into analytics platforms, dashboards, and decision-support systems.

üîë Key Functionalities
1Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Generator

Converts natural language queries into optimized SQL.

Supports any SQL database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MS SQL, etc.).

Dynamically fetches both structured and unstructured data.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Chart Generator

Automatically generates charts and graphs (bar, line, pie, scatter, etc.) from SQL results.

Ensures contextually relevant visualization selection.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Insight Generator

Uses LLMs to summarize and explain query results.

Provides trends, comparisons, and predictive insights.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Output Formatter

Formats query results into clean, structured tables.

Standardizes outputs for easy interpretation or export.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Session Memory (RAM-based)

Custom lightweight memory module stores the last n interactions.

Enables context-aware, multi-turn queries in a single session.

6Ô∏è‚É£ FastAPI Backend

Orchestrates the multi-agent pipeline.

Exposes REST APIs for external integrations.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Streamlit Dashboard

User-friendly interactive interface.

Displays charts, tables, and insights dynamically.
